          <h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
          <p>
            Affiliate links are special tracking links that allow us to earn a small commission when you make a purchase 
            after clicking on them. These links help support our website and allow us to continue providing free, 
            high-quality content and reviews.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Amazon Associates Program</h2>
          <p>
            Blicksel Picks is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program 
            designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com and 
            other Amazon websites worldwide including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Amazon.com (United States)</li>
            <li>Amazon.ca (Canada)</li>
            <li>Amazon.co.uk (United Kingdom)</li>
            <li>Amazon.de (Germany)</li>
            <li>Amazon.fr (France)</li>
            <li>Amazon.it (Italy)</li>
            <li>Amazon.es (Spain)</li>
            <li>Amazon.com.au (Australia)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Other Affiliate Programs</h2>
          <p>In addition to Amazon, we may participate in affiliate programs with other retailers and service providers, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Best Buy</li>

          <h2>How We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
          <p>
            We include affiliate links in our product reviews, buying guides, and recommendations. 
            When you click on these links and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission. 
            The commission comes from the retailer, not from you, so it doesn't affect the price you pay.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Our Editorial Independence</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Our affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial content or recommendations.</strong> 
            We maintain complete editorial independence and only recommend products that we genuinely believe in. Our review process includes:

            <li>Conducting thorough, unbiased evaluations</li>
            <li>Highlighting both pros and cons of each product</li>
            <li>Recommending alternatives when appropriate</li>
            <li>Updating reviews when better options become available</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Transparency in Recommendations</h2>

          </ul>
          
          <h2>Price and Availability</h2>

            We are not responsible for price changes or product availability after publication. 
            Always check the current price and availability on the retailer's website before making a purchase.
          </p>
